summary: A small project to detect rhizobium nodes in legumes roots using OpenCV and K-Means.
---

It is a small project, designed to match rhizobia nodes in a given image through a pre-select match template image, where the application return a list of node-locations that the match template algorithm detected, however some of then are not rhizobia nodes, to fix that, we use K-Means to reduce to number of matchs in same locations and to discard outside hits of matching template algorithm.
